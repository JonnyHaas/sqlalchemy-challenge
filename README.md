# The Module 10 Challenge was a success for Analyzing and exploring historical # data related to climate in Honolulu, Hawaii as Defined in Part 1 of the Challenge.
# Part 1 was completed in Jupyter Notebook. 
# I created a Surfsup folder, but did not use it. 
# The data showed the following per instructions:
#   - Most Recent Date: 2017-08-23
#   - Bar graph showing preciptiation over last 12 months
#   - Summary statistics for precipitation
#   - Total number of stations
#   - The most active stations
#   - Lowest, highest and average temperature from most active station
#   - Histogram of temperature observations at most active station.
# Last script closes the session

# The Module 10 Challenge was also a success for Design of Climate App as required in Part 2 of the Challenge.
# Part 2 was completed in Visual Studio Code
# per the instructions, a Flask API was designed to:
#   - Start a home page and list all available routes
#   - Query results from Preciitation analysis only retrieving last 12 months
#   - Return list of stations
#   - Query dates and temperatures from most active station
#   - List Min. Temp., Ave. Temp., and Max. Temp.

# I utilized notes from class, visited with classmate Bobbi Fletchall, and utilized ChatGPT to help me write code.
